# UdaciCards: A Simple Mobile Flashcards App

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course. 

## To setup & run the project:

* download or clone this repo
* install all project dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`
* start the development server with `yarn start` or `npm start`


## Project Info:  

* This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-native-app](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). 
* I used [Native Base](https://nativebase.io/) for some of the components.
* I have tested this app on an `iOS` device (my iPhone) only, using [Expo iOS app](https://expo.io/tools#client).
